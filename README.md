# **Data Science Jobs and Salary Averages in Europeüíªüåêüí∂**

The main reason why you should review this project is to get an approach about the development of **Business Intelligence (BI)**, which impacts many industries and departments, including finance, marketing, operations, and human resources.

**What is BI, then?** In a nutshell, is the mixed set of technologies, processes and tools **that** gathers, analyzes, and presents data to perform **visualizations (dashboards)** of business analytics, to make data-driven decisions, or‚Ä¶

> *"Something that personally I want to include: Call-To-Actions or CTAs".*

## 1. Project description üëá
To put into practice the concepts about **BI Reports and Dashboards**, I worked on a dataset found in [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) related to my career development: [**Data Science**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data/data).

 **The main challenge** was to build a BI Report/Dashboard from the topic I chose for this project, that focus on getting insights about **job opportunities in the field of data science, as well as salary averages in Europe**. It is designed for individuals interested in pursuing work opportunities in the tech field.

 ## **2. Technology stack üíª**

#### Graphic Design Platform:
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): Profile Persona Template

#### Data Visualization Software:
- [Tableau Public 2023.3](https://www.tableau.com/products/public)

## **3. Minimal Functional App ‚öôÔ∏è**

To know the purpose of our visualization, **first** we must know the audience we will present it to, in order to prepare our visualization and give the right message with the right words.

For this case, I developed a fictional character for the **Profile Persona** named Lucia, which the visualization will allow her to **take decisions about** what skills should be trained for **and** what countries offers the best for her professional development.

With this **Profile Persona**, we can formulate possible questions the people (represented by Lucia) would ask. With the Dashboard (specially if is an static report), we could give answers to them.


> **Note:** "Static" means if the dashboard is like an image.


#### How does it work?
From the **Profile Persona** I formulated the following question they need answer for:

- What positions can I start with in the job market if my background is related to Sales?
- What are the salaries of tech positions related to my career?
- What options do I have to work, and at the same time maintain frequent contact with family and friends?
- How can I immediately ensure my entry into the job market?
- Should I look for work in Spain? In a nearby country? or Remote?

**The following step was** to load the dataset in Tableau and perform my report/dashboard to communicate my insights, as you can see as follows:

![Dashboard](https://github.com/AndrewBavuels/ih_datamadpt0923_project_m2/raw/main/images/BI%20Report-Dashboard.png)

> The previous output is exported in Tableau Public.

At a glance, the **insights** I could get from the Dashboard, based on Lucia's questions, are the following ones:

- It starts with the area Data Analysis, according to her "quote" in the Profile Persona.

- Data Analyst instead of Business Data Analyst, because the first one has 37 job records and more probability of getting a job. **Instead of the Business one role** with just 2 records and a lower salary average than the first one.

- There‚Äôs the option to start immediately in Part-time and to take a course in her free time to enhance her skills.

- Most of the Data Analyst roles are in Spain, which **she can afford to start with an In-person job** with an average salary around ‚Ç¨ 42,000 per year. 

## **4. Main conclusions üìÅ**

With this report, Lucia made her decision of getting the tools and trainings to enhance her business and sales background to get an entry in the Tech Market as a Data Analyst.

What motivates her the most is staying in Spain because of the high probabilities to achive her goals, along with keeping on touch with family and friends.

This is just the beginning of Lucia professional growth. For more details, [**click here**](https://public.tableau.com/views/Readme_mdProjectM2DataScience/1_Overview?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to interact with the dynamic dashboard.
