- Tell them what it is (with context).
- Show them what it looks like in action.
- Show them how they use it.
- Tell them any other relevant details.

**Formatting**
Your readers will most likely view your README in a browser so please keep that in mind when formatting its content: 
- Use proper format when necesary (e.g.: `import pandas as pd`). 
- Categorize content using two or three levels of header beneath. 
- Make use of **emphasis** to call out important words. 
- Link to project pages for related libraries you mention. Link to Wikipedia, Wiktionary, even Urban Dictionary definitions for words of which a reader may not be familiar. Make amusing cultural references. 
- Add links to related projects or services. 

The main reason why you should review this project is to get an approach about the development of **Business Intelligence (BI)**, which impacts many industries and departments, including finance, marketing, operations, and human resources.

**What is BI, then?** In a nutshell, is the mixed set of technologies, processes and tools **that** gathers, analyzes, and presents data to perform **visualizations (dashboards)** of business analytics, making data-driven decisions, or…

## 1. Project description 👇
> Project Module 2 - Part time Sept 2023 - [Ironhack Madrid - Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/es-en/data-analytics)

To put into practice the concepts about **BI Reports and Dashboards**, I worked on a dataset found in [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) related to my career development: [**Data Science**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data/data).

 **The main challenge** is to build a BI Report/Dashboard 
 
 using a dataset of your choice.

 visualization requeriments and interactivity performance. I used Tableau as my main tool for creating my reporting app.


This project focus on getting insights about job opportunities in the field of data science, as well as salary averages in Europe. It is designed for individuals interested in pursuing work opportunities in the tech field

## **2. Minimal Functional App ⚙️**

The visualization allows to take decisions about what skills should be trained for and what countries offers the best for their professional development:

- [Daniel the Audience Persona XXXXXX](https://platzi.com/cursos/tableau/) (Desarrollar la idea con mis hallazgos)

> This b **xxxx.**

#### How does it work?
For example: the main xxxxxx:
```
INSERT DATA VISUALIZATION IMAGE HERE
```
As you can see, XXXXXXXXXXXX:


> The previous output is exported in aTableau XXXXXX.


## **3. Technology stack 💻**

#### Data Visualization Software:
